This program has been created to modify the data files used with O\-F\-E\-L\-I. Those files are written in X\-M\-L and have the extension \char`\"{}.\-dat\char`\"{}. The only requirement to use it is to install Qt (follow this link for more information \href{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/installation.html}{\tt Installation Qt}

To build the program from sources you can use the script \char`\"{}compil\char`\"{}, or you can follow this procedure \-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item launch the command \char`\"{}qmake -\/o Makefile I\-H\-M\-\_\-\-O\-F\-E\-L\-I.\-pro\char`\"{} to generate the makefile
\item then use \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} to build the program, this will create an executable named I\-H\-M\-\_\-\-O\-F\-E\-L\-I To launch the program, just use \char`\"{}./\-I\-H\-M\-\_\-\-O\-F\-E\-L\-I\char`\"{}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

With this program you can create a new data file for O\-F\-E\-L\-I or modify an existing file. The creation of a new file can be performed by using the default file provided with the program as a base. Once this file is opened, you can modify it as you wish. For the modification, this program allows you to perform all the operations you should need (add/delete tag, add/delete comment, modification of a tag, modification of attributes).
